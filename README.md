Welcome to the [mod.io SDK](https://apps.mod.io/sdk) repository, built using C and C++. It allows game developers to host and automatically install user-created mods in their games. It connects to the [mod.io API](https://docs.mod.io), and [documentation for its functions](https://github.com/modio/SDK/wiki) can be viewed here.

## Getting started

If you are a game developer and want to add mod.io SDK functionality to your project visit our [documentation overview](https://github.com/modio/SDK/wiki). Our [getting started guide](https://apps.mod.io/guides/getting-started) is a good place to start if you are completely new to [mod.io](https://mod.io).

## Contributions Welcome
Our SDK is public and open source. Game developers are welcome to utilize it directly, to add support for mods in their games, or fork it to create plugins and wrappers for other engines and codebases. Many of these [contributions are shared](https://apps.mod.io) here. Want to make changes to our SDK? Submit a pull request with your recommended changes to be reviewed.

## Wrappers

mod.io SDK wrappers are available for the following languages and engines:

* [Haxe wrapper](https://apps.mod.io/haxe-wrapper) for game engines such as OpenFL, Kha or awe5. Available on [Github](https://github.com/Turupawn/modioHaxe).
* [Unreal Engine](https://apps.mod.io/unreal-engine-plugin) integration tutorial and plugin on the works.

Are you creating a wrapper? [Let us know](http://discord.mod.io)!

### Building instructions

Learn how to build mod.io SDK in our [building instruction guide](https://github.com/modio/SDK/wiki/Building).

### Code contributions

1. Fork it
2. Add new features

git commit -am 'Add some feature'
git push origin my-new-feature
```
3. Create a pull request

### Reporting a bug

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/modio/SDK/issues). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
